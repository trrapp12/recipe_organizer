Project Repository
==================

Welcome.  I'm glad to see you.  My name is Trevor Rapp.  I'm an intern at Coding Campus in Provo, Utah.  Hopefully if you've made it to my github readme
files you've figured out that much at least.  If not, that's okay too.  This readme file will attempt to guide you
through my exercises.  What you can hope to get from reading this is a more indepth look at who I am as a programmer.
How you can best achieve that would be to take a look at the bullet points and find something that interests you and then
cross-reference that with the file that corresponds to with the file name description.  All project names will appear like
this:

1 File Name
_________

What will follow the file name will be a description of what the file deals with and a description of the lessons learned.
It will look like this:

2 Second File
-------------
-Description: lesson on MD formatting codes

-Lessons learned:  I learned how to apply bullets in MD

Hopefully this explanation is straight forward enough. For any questions about myself, my work, or permissions, you can
contact me at trrapp@gmail.com.  Or feel free to friend me on facebook, link to me on LinkedIn, or check out my Instagram,
or Twitter.

Close_far
---------
-Creating a function that returns True if integer values are close to eachother.

-Struggled with the logic.  Had to refactor numerous times.

Exercise 2.py
-------------
-given input, write a program that decides if it is a weekend or a holiday, and return True if one of those is true.

-Lessons learned.  Put a space after commas in an argument.  Capitalize the True in your conditional statements.
Make sure the print command comes before the return command or else it will return before it ever prints anything.
The logic is pretty simple.  The "!=" argument allows us to make an coniditional argument for a negative condition
instead of a positive one.  For example, we can check to see if something "isn't" instead of checking to see if it "is."
The if statement checks on condition first and then if that is not met it moves to the else conidition and checks for that.
The "if" "and" statement simply means that both conditions have to be true for it to return true for that argument.

Exercise 4.py
_____________
-Create a menu that gathers user input, and cycles through a while loop and requires them to input certain options.

-Some mistakes that I've made on this program were that I used the = sign in the while loop.  I should have used == instead to make a comparison' \
because = is assigning a value.  The elif statements need to be indented because they are part of the loop that runs.
To exit the loop the else needs to be on the same indentation line as the while.  I put everything evaluating to 1 as an integer,
but what people put in will be evaluated as a string, so I needed to put quotes around the numbers.  Also, I needed to include 2, and 3 as
options that could be evaluated because otherwise they wouldn't be included in the loop. I didn't need to put return in there
because the while loop returns it automatically for us.

Exercise 5.py
-------------
-Create a random number generator, use that to create a list of randomly generated letters, then count through the letters
and tell how many of each letter was produced.

-The hardest parts were figuring out how to generate a truly random number of characters, then figuring out how to capture
them.  I decided I wanted to print them to a text file, which then lead me to the issue of opening the file and retrieving
the data for use so that I could count through it.

Exercise 6 from 17 April 2015
-----------------------------
-Information coming

-Information coming

Morning exercise 4 monkeys.py
-----------------------------
-Return True if both the monkeys are smiling or if neither of them are.

-lessons learned.  True and false statements should be capitalized.  Pep 8 said that in an if conditional
statement that it is better to use if ____ and _____ is True rather than saying if ____ and ____ == True.
I used and Else if statement but wrote it "Else if" instead of Elif.

Squirrel play.py
--------------
-return true if the numbers are between certain values and if a boolean is True

-Information coming

Sum 13.py
---------
-return all values in an array except for 13 and the next number after 13.

-Information coming

Warm_up -3.py
-------------
-Information coming

-Information coming

Warm-up-2.py
------------
-return the absolute difference of n-21 and double the absolute difference if n > 21

-Lessons learned.  When call the function in a print job, make sure it actually matches the original name
of the function.  If and Else are not capitalized.

afternoon exercise 2
--------------------
-set up a conversion that will translate from miles per hour to barleycorns/day, furlongs/fortnight, Mach number, and
Percentage of Speed of Light

-learned how to use arithmatic operators and set up equations.

example.py
----------
-Information coming

-Information coming

exercise_1.py
-------------
-ask a user to input an integer, capture the integer, apply arithmatic operations to the integer and concantenate them to
a string, and create an error code if the user inputs a string instead of an integer.

-Learned a lot about the importance of statement orders in my logic.

first last6 list.py
-------------------
-Return True if the number 6 is at the beginning or end of an array

-Information coming

log.txt
-------
-This was not an exercise in itself, but rather the txt file I used to store information from a previous exercise

rating your stylishness.py
--------------------------
-return True if you or your partners "stylishness" falls within a certain number range, False if it is within a lower range, or False if
or False if a single persons value is also too low.

-Information coming

same_first_last exercise for 23 April 2015.py
---------------------------------------------
-Given an array of ints, return True if the array is length 1 or more,
and the first element and the last element are equal.

-lessons learned: if you are referring to the array make sure the name of the valuse inside the function you call
is listed before the [].

temperature converter project II.py
-----------------------------------
-with mix of key value pairs, return a list of cities and their corresponding temperatures, check to see if the temperature
was reported in Celsius or Fahrenheit and then return the temperature converted to the alternate form.  Then return them
all in a string that states what the temperature for that city is.

-Information coming
warm_up 15 April 2015.py
------------------------
-Create two classes, an Employee and a Job, where the Employee class has-a Job class.
When printing an instance of the employee object the output should look something like this:

My name is Morgan Williams, I am 24 years old and I am a Software Developer

-Learned how to create classes, define instances of the classes, and then use them in functions.
