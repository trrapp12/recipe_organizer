###What is it? 
---

The recipe organizer is a web-based app that allows users to manage their recipes in the cloud instead of in a tin can.

###This project demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] It has basic CRUD functionality allowing users to add, edit, and delete recipes.
- [x] It allows users to collect, sort, organize, and browse recipes.
- [x] It allows for photos to be uploaded. 
- [x] It allows users to sort and retrieve recipes by name or by ingredient type.
- [x] It links to a few Pinterest sites for resources to other recipes.

###What is under the hood?

The recipe organizer uses a Django framework on an SQLite database.  It also uses Angular to make calls to the backend and to control the MVC.  Other technologies involved include JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

###Why can't I see any code for it? 

It has been pushed to the server branch for publication purposes.  If you can't see it look to see if you are on the master or the server branch.  The server branch has the most up-to-date code.
